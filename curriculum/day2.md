# React Workshop - Day 2

# Release 0

In this release we are going to be playing around with state and passing functions as props.

Your challenge is to make your app be able to use the links within the Navbar Component in order to switch between the items rendered within content as shown in the example below.

![example page 2](/images/example_page_2.gif?raw=true "Example Page 2")

This challenge relies on your understanding of how state is controlled and managed in a React Component. If stuck, make your first task to have Content display Home, About or Contact based on hard-coded props passed to it.

# Release 1

This release is all about how to tackle the react component life cycle

Your challenge here is to implement a loading screen such as the one depicted on the [example site](https://react-profile-workshop.herokuapp.com).

This challenge forces you to rethink the current structure of your application. If you're stuck, think about what level a loading screen component would be compared to the other components of the application. Does it exist within a part of the page already being displayed? Is it on the same level as part of the page being displayed? Do you need to extract any part of your App component into a separate component?

If you're looking to set a time for how long the loading screen lasts, look into the [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) method.
